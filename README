this is a perl script to convert the webbotlib speech sythesizer code from avr
to msp430 usage. this script is use at your own risk giftware. webbotlib has
it's own license terms.

. locate "webbotlib" and download version 2.x, i tried w/ webbotavrclib-1.35
. inside the package locate and extract the Audio/Text2Speech directory
. u will see the following files

Text2Speech.h
phoneme2sound.c
phonemeWriter.c
sound2noise.c
speech2phoneme.c
speechWriter.c
vocab_en.c

. place these files in a same directory as this (zconv.pl) script
. run it again and this script will
  . extract what's needed, ignore others
  . combine into a tighter package name "../webbot_speech.h"
  . replace avr controls w/ msp430 controls
. to use it in your firmware, do
  . include "webbot_speech.h"
  . say("Hello World");
  . enjoy :) and thanks webbot
